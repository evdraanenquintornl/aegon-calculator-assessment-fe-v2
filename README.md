# AegonSimpleCalculator

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.12.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Feedback from previous attempt:

- Should have used class for the request, is now one string array, which causes hacky code
- No tests
- input validation is not very descriptive 

I've corrected the class usage for the requests and added a few unit tests.
The calculator has been made simpler, which I hope is an improvement on the input descriptions.

I'm aware the frontend isn't as polished as the backend, this has been my choice due to the amount of feedback on it from the previous attempt.
